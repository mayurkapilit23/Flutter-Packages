# Flutter-Packages

modal_progress_hud_nsn This Flutter package is used to show a loading spinner (progress indicator) over the entire screen while an async task is running (like login or data fetch). It helps block user interaction until the task is complete.

âœ… Useful for showing loading during API calls or form submissions.

Example:

    ModalProgressHUD(
      inAsyncCall: isLoading,
      child: YourWidget(),
    )
